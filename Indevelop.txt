Plan :

Plan is to create a reports directory and work in this repository and see the changes on Github

So I created an empty repository in Github and cloned it in my system .
so the initial branch will be master . 

Created a new branch develop and doing the  developments there .

Commands used :
git clone https://github.com/manikanta-kondeti/Reports-
git add *
git commit -am ""
git branch develop
git checkout develop 

Now I have to do merge both of the files .
git checkout master 
git merge 
git push
