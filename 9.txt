Learnt Node js a bit and  tried to write in it. (Worked efficiently for half of the time)

Errors faced: No proper implementation of the example given in the site.  
Method Followed: 
Facebook has two types methods for its app environment in the mobile. 
We need opening login button through internal app.  
So we have first implemented the example in the given site and later combined with our app. It was perfectly mixed :) 


About Routing: 

Have to read the research paper and follow that algorithm to get it perfectly done. 
Monday free - complete it as soon as possible.
