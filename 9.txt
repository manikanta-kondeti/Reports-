-----Hackathon 
48hour Hackathon at Google Hyderabad office. It was fantastic and very useful to learn about cordova , facebook joining them. 
Learnt Node js a bit and  tried to write in it. (Worked efficiently for half of the time)

Useful links to integrate this cordova into mobile app.
https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-facebook-plugin
Errors faced: No proper implementation of the example given in the site.  
Method Followed: 
Facebook has two types methods for its app environment in the mobile. 
We need opening login button through internal app.  
So we have first implemented the example in the given site and later combined with our app. It was perfectly mixed :) 


-----About Routing: 

Have to read the research paper and follow that algorithm to get it perfectly done. 
Monday free - complete it as soon as possible.


-----What I understood about pgrouting :

each algorithm has some similar set of directories.
/src /sql /doc /tools /test /tester
In src dir we have the c file which is used to read the tuples from databses. 
A .h file which stores all the definitions of data structures. 
An a wrapper file which has the algorithm implemented in it. 

Read from database-- Using SPI Interface.
