--- Paper on Symmetric and asymmetric VRP with Simultaneous Pick-up and Delivery.

This is called VRP-SDP. It is an extension to CVRP.Let us assume set C will be of customers. 
So each customer needs two things 1.) Pick-up and Delivery. 

----Objectives :
Set of routes that minimizes the transportation costs (or) distances traveled , where the customer demands are satisfied and vehicle load capacities are not exceeded anytime. 

--- Sec 2 : 

It explains all practical applications that can be done using this algorithm. 

----Sec 4 :

In this section it explains about all the mathematical models that can help in solving the problem.

Model -1 :
Vehicle Flow Model.

Model -2 :
Commodity flow model.

I suggest you to directly read sec-1 and sec-4
