Abstract : 

	Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows is next to capacity constraint routing problem. The VRPTW is NP-complete and instances with 100 customers can'nt be worked here. It comes under multi-objective optimization. It also uses Pareto Ranking. Pareto Ranking states that one can not make something better without making something bad. So the final Output of it may be equal. Coming to the Multi-Objective optimization genetic algorithm returns a set of Solutions that fairly consider both of these dimensions. Our approach is quite effective , as it is competetive with best known in the literature. Multi-Objective will be Number of vehicles and Cost (Distance). It is also comes under genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that mimcs Natural selection.
